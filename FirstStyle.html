                <h3><b> HISTORY </b></h3> <br>
                <p> Green cars, green cleaners, green plywood. Today there are eco-friendly alternatives in virtually every product category. Consumer interest in green products continues to rise as more products are introduced each year. It becomes increasingly more difficult to imagine a time when climate change and sustainability weren’t a concern. In less than a generation we’ve gone from giving little consideration to sustainability to it becoming part of most people’s daily lives.
                    With all the information coming at us every day, it’s often hard to get perspective. In this series focusing on the history of green brands and marketing, I’m hoping to provide that perspective–to give context to where we are with green marketing, how we got here, and where green marketing is possibly headed.</p>

                <h3><b> HISTORY </b></h3> <br>
                <p>For the majority of the world’s population the 1960s were “before I was born.” In the ’60s we had the pesticide DDT on our vegetables, lead in our paint, and asbestos siding on our houses. These and other environmental health and safety issues weren’t concerns to the general public in those days. Consumers were often unaware of the environmental dangers in their homes and surroundings. It took a couple of high-profile books to alert everyone to these dangers. Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s breakthrough book published in 1962, documented the effects of pesticide pollution and is credited with beginning the environmental movement in the United States. 
                    Written in response to a question about bird deaths, Silent Spring was the first breakthrough environmental book to appear on the New York Times best-seller list. Carson argued that pesticide spraying was harmful to wildlife as well as humans, and subsequent studies ultimately led to a ban on DDT in the United States in 1972.</p>

                <h3><b> HISTORY </b></h3> <br>
                <p> If in the 1960s mainstream consumers’ eyes opened to environmental and safety dangers, it was in the 1970s when the U.S. government responded. As environmental events continued to alarm consumers (including the Arab oil embargo, the Ford Pinto recall, Three Mile Island, and Love Canal), the U.S. government and nongovernmental organizations stepped in to introduce legal protection for the environment and consumers. The 1970s saw the passing of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, as well as the creation of both the EPA and OSHA. The Natural Resources Defense Council was also created and the first Earth Day was held.
                    Despite emerging environmental awareness, not many products were marketed in a way that today would be considered “green.” However, some products were beginning to appeal to a small but growing consumer segment that rejected mainstream consumer brands. Food cooperatives selling organic, natural products flourished. </p>
