                    <h3><b> Description </b></h3>
                    <p> TOMS shows that today’s consumers shouldn’t have to choose between looking good and doing good. The company offers consumers a chance to give something back whenever they make a purchase, and that’s something that appeals to the socially-conscious community of the day. If you want to take a similar approach with your sustainability strategy, consider teaming up with a non-profit so you can give a portion of your proceeds to a cause that you care about.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3><b> History </b></h3>
                    <p>Blake Mycoskie visited Argentina in 2002 while competing in the second season of The Amazing Race with his sister. He returned on vacation in January 2006, and met a woman who was volunteering to deliver shoes to children. Mycoskie offered to help and has cited the shoe distribution experience, and the many shoeless children he encountered, as the birth of his idea for his eventual company.
                        He decided to develop a type of alpargata (a simple canvas slip-on shoe that is popular in Argentina)or the North American market, with the goal of providing a new pair of free shoes to youth of Argentina and other developing nations for every pair sold.</p><br>

                    <h3><b> Description </b></h3>
                    <p>One of the world’s most popular outdoor brands, Patagonia doesn’t just have a great reputation for its wide selection of durable clothing. This unique brand also has a mission to build the best product, without harming the environment in any way.
                        The great thing about Patagonia is that the business is completely honest about its practices. The company knows that not everything it does is eco friendly. For instance, Patagonia has to use fossil fuels to produce some of the outer-shells on their coats. </p>

                    <h3><b> History </b></h3>
                    <p> Yvon Chouinard, an accomplished rock climber,began selling hand forged mountain climbing gear in 1957 through his company Chouinard Equipment. He worked alone selling his gear until 1965 when he partnered with Tom Frost in order to improve his products and address the growing supply and demand issue he faced.
                        In 1970, Chouinard obtained rugby shirts from Scotland that he wore while climbing because the collar kept the climbing sling from hurting his neck.
                        Great Pacific Iron Works, Patagonia's first store, opened in 1973 in the former Hobson meat-packing plant at Santa Clara St, in Ventura, near Chouinard's blacksmith shop.In 1981, Patagonia and Chouinard Equipment were incorporated within Great Pacific Iron Works.</p><br>

                      <h3><b> Description </b></h3>
                      <p> Finally, Apple is the talk of the tech world right now, once again, after just announcing the arrival of the new iPhone 11. As part of the new launch, Apple tried to draw attention to its green initiatives. Although it hasn’t always been one of the top eco friendly companies, Apple has been taking additional steps lately to prove that it does care about the environment.

                        For instance, the iPhone 11 is available in various materials, including 100% recycled aluminum. Additionally, Apple uses various recycled components within the internal elements of the phone too.</p>
                     
                        <h3><b> History </b></h3>
                        <p> Apple Computers, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who brought to the new company a vision of changing the way people viewed computers. Jobs and Wozniak wanted to make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices. Simply put, they wanted a computer that was user-friendly. As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company—reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. </p>
